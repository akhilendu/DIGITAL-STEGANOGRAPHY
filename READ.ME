                       Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such way that no one apart from the sender and the intended recipient knows of the existence of the message. It is the method of hiding a secret message inside of another form of data. There are many different carriers for steganography, out of which, the most popular ones are digital images. It is used to overcome the problems of cryptography which is an older version of storing secret messages.
                       Our project, Digital Steganography overcomes this factor and it gives a solution for transmitting secret formation without affecting unintended users. Steganography uses multimedia data as a covering medium (Covering secret information). By using steganography data (secret information) can hiden with in data (multimedia data, here multimedia data is an image) and it can be sent anywhere to transfer the message easily without giving any suspicion to others.
